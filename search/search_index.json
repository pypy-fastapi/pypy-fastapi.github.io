The critical 20% of FastAPI to learn includes:</p> <ul> <li>Routing and Endpoints: Understand how to define routes using <code>@app.get()</code>, <code>@app.post()</code>, etc.</li> <li>Request and Response Handling: Learn to handle query parameters, path parameters, and JSON request bodies, and return responses with proper status codes.</li> <li>Pydantic Models: Master Pydantic for data validation and serialization.</li> <li>Dependency Injection: Use FastAPI\u2019s dependency system for reusable logic (e.g., authentication, database connections).</li> <li>Async/Await: Grasp asynchronous programming to leverage FastAPI\u2019s performance (e.g., <code>async def</code> for endpoints).</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/","title":"Index","text":""},{"location":"blog/#blog","title":"Blog","text":""}]}
